A Machine Learning Pipeline for Climate Science
===============================================

This repository is an end-to-end pipeline for the creation, intercomparison and evaluation of machine learning methods in climate science.

The pipeline carries out a number of tasks to create a unified-data format for training and testing machine learning methods.

These tasks are split into the different classes defined in the `src` folder, and explained further below:
